The project on converting text to speech using Python involves creating a program that transforms written text into audible speech. This is achieved using the `gtts` (Google Text-to-Speech) library, which provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing Google's TTS API. By inputting a string of text, the `gtts` function converts it into an audio file in various languages and accents. This project is particularly useful for applications such as voice assistants, accessibility tools for the visually impaired, and any system that benefits from auditory feedback. The simplicity of the `gtts` library makes it an excellent choice for developers looking to implement text-to-speech functionality efficiently.
